# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.
#own_window_class alacritty
# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
#env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  #TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 0
    lines: 0

  # Window position (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of pixels.
  # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
  #position:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: full

  # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:
  #   - Windowed
  #   - Maximized
  #   - Fullscreen
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode` (macOS only):
  #   - SimpleFullscreen
  startup_mode: Windowed

  # Window title
  #title: Alacritty

  #Window class (Linux only):
  class: Alacritty

  #scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
  #history: 10000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  #multiplier: 3

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal
  # should scroll when the alternate screen buffer is active. This is used
  # to allow mouse scrolling for applications like `man`.
  #
  # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.
  #faux_multiplier: 3

  # Scroll to the bottom when new text is written to the terminal.
  auto_scroll: true
# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.
#tabspaces: 8

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  normal:
    family: Cascadia Code
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Regular

  # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: Source Code Pro
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Bold

  # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: Source Code Pro
    # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
    # style: Italic


  # Point size
  size: 19

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 1
    y: 1

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
  # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  use_thin_strokes: true

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: true
